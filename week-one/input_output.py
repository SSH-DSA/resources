# Every program we write aims to complete a certain task.
# In order to do that, it needs to take some input, process it, and produce some output.
# In this lesson, we'll learn how to take input from the user and how to produce output.

# Showing that Python is an intepreted language
# Python is an interpreted language, which means that it is executed line by line.

# print("Hello, World!")

# print("Hello, World!")
      

#Output
#The simplest way to produce output is to use the print() function.
#The print() function takes one or more arguments, and displays them on the screen.
#The arguments can be of any data type.

#Example:

# print("Hello, World!")

# print(3)
# print("Hello, World!", 3, 4.5)

# string = "Hello World"

# print("The address of string is: ", id(string))
# print("The value of string is: ", string)



# Variables
# Variables are used to store data.
# A variable is a name that refers to a value.
# The value can be of any data type, such as an integer or a string.
# Variables are created when they are first assigned a value.
# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.

name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, ", name)
print("The address of name is: ", id(name))
# The input() function is used to take input from the user.
# The input() function takes one argument, which is the prompt string.
